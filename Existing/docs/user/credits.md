ArchivesSpace (http://archivesspace.org) is community-supported software whose ongoing development is led, managed, implemented and funded by a diverse community of users, developers, and administrators all working together to achieve the goal of helping archives and cultural heritage institutions better manage and provide access to their collections.

ArchivesSpace 1.0 (released in 2013) was developed by [Hudson Molonglo](http://www.hudsonmolonglo.com)
in partnership with the New York University Libraries, UC San Diego
Libraries, and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Library and with
funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, organizational support from
LYRASIS, and contributions from diverse persons in the archives community.
